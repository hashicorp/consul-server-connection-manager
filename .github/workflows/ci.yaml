  # This is job is required for branch protection as a required GitHub check
  # because GitHub actions show up as checks at the job level and not the
  # workflow level.  This is currently a feature request:
  # https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/12395
  #
  # This job must:
  # - be placed after the fanout of a workflow so that everything fans back in
  #   to this job.
  # - "need" any job that is part of the fan out / fan in
  # - include if: always() logic because we may have conditional jobs that this job
  #   needs, and this would potentially get skipped if a previous job got skipped.
  #   The if clause ensures it does not get skipped.
