## Summary

This is a Go library used to connect to a [HashiCorp Consul](https://www.consul.io/) server. It
implements server discovery and provides a gRPC connection to a Consul server.

It was designed to maintain a current connection to a Consul server in absence of a Consul client
agent.

It supports the following:

* Discovering Consul server addresses using
  [go-netaddrs](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-netaddrs) and Consul's [ServerWatch gRPC
  stream](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/main/proto-public/pbserverdiscovery/serverdiscovery.proto)
* Connecting to a Consul server over gRPC
* Automatic rediscovery and reconnection to another Consul server
* Consul ACL token authentication
* Compatibility with Consul server xDS load balancing
* Optional custom server filtering

## Usage

First, import the library:

```go
import "github.com/hashicorp/consul-server-connection-manager/discovery"
```

The following shows how to configure and start a `Watcher`. The
`Watcher` runs continually to discover Consul server addresses
and to maintain a current gRPC connection to a Consul server.

```go
watcher, err := discovery.NewWatcher(
    ctx,
    discovery.Config{
        Addresses: "exec=./discover-ips.sh",
        GRPCPort:  8502,
        TLS:       tlsCfg,
        Credentials: discovery.Credentials{
            Static: discovery.StaticTokenCredential{
                Token: testToken,
            },
        },
    },
    hclog.New(&hclog.LoggerOptions{
        Name: "server-connection-manager",
    }),
)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Start the Watcher. It runs continually to maintain a current gRPC connection
// to one of the Consul servers.
go watcher.Run()

// Stop the Watcher when we are done.
// This will close the gRPC connection for you.
defer watcher.Stop()

// Get initial state. This blocks until a Consul server is discovered and until
// the Watcher has a successful connection to a Consul server.
state, err := watcher.State()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Now use the gRPC connection to initalize your gRPC clients.
// This gRPC connection is valid as long as the Watcher is running.
// The connection automatically switches to another Consul as needed.
// If applicable, the ACL token is automatically injected into requests on the
// connection.
client := myclient.NewSampleClient(state.GRPCConn)
```

### Usage for HTTP Clients

The library does not currently integrate directly with HTTP clients, so
you must rebuild or update your HTTP client when the Watcher switches to
a new Consul server.

The following shows how to subscribe to receive an update each time the Watcher
switches to another Consul server.

```go
// Configure and start the Watcher.
watcher, err := discovery.NewWatcher(...)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
go watcher.Run()
defer watcher.Stop()

// Wait for initial state.
state, err := watcher.State()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Sample function to create a Consul HTTP API client,
// when using "github.com/hashicorp/consul/api".
//
// The state contains the server address and ACL token (if applicable).
makeClient := func(s discovery.State) *api.Client {
    cfg := api.DefaultConfig()
    // Append the Consul HTTP(S) port (8500 or 8501)
    cfg.Address = fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", s.Address, 8501)
    cfg.Token = s.Token
    return api.NewClient(cfg)
}

// Create a client the first time.
client := makeClient(state)

// Subscribe to the Watcher. This returns a channel that receives
// a new discovery.State whenever the Watches connects to another
// Consul server
ch := watcher.Subscribe()

// Monitor the channel and rebuild the client when needed
for {
    select {
    case state := <-ch:
        client = makeClient(state)
    case <-ctx.Done():
        log.Fatal(ctx.Err())
    }
}
```

### Servers Behind a Load Balancer

By default, the Watcher opens a
[`WatchServers`](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/main/proto-public/pbserverdiscovery/serverdiscovery.proto)
gRPC stream after connecting to a Consul server. This stream notifies us of new or changed Consul
server addresses.

The server watch stream should be disabled for cases where `WatchServers` returns different
addresses than those we should connect to. For example, if your Consul servers are behind a load
balancer, the library should connect to the load balancer address rather than directly to one of the
Consul server addresses.

When the server watch stream is disabled, the Watcher periodically makes a gRPC request to its
current server to check if it can still connect to that server. By default, it makes a gRPC request
once per minute, which can be changed by setting the `ServerWatchDisabledInterval`.

```go
cfg := discovery.Config{
    Addresses: "my.loadbalancer.example.com",
    // This disables use of the WatchServers stream.
    ServerWatchDisabled: true,
    // The following is the default value for a periodic connect to the server.
    ServerWatchDisabledInterval: 1 * time.Minute,
}
```

#### Server Watch Unsupported

Additionally, the `WatchServers` stream is not used if a particular Consul server does not support
`WatchServers`. The Watcher determines feature support by fetching the [supported dataplane
features](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul/blob/main/proto-public/pbdataplane/dataplane.proto)
and checking for the `DATAPLANE_FEATURES_WATCH_SERVERS` feature in the response.

When `WatchServers` is unsupported, the Watcher works the same as when `ServerWatchDisabled = true`.
It periodically makes a gRPC request to check if it can still conect to the current server, at an
interval controlled by the `ServerWatchDisabledInterval`.

### Server Filtering

By default, the Watcher will choose any server at random. You can pass `ServerEvalFn` to have the
Watcher ignore certain servers. This function is called each time the Watcher selects a new server.
When the function returns false, the Watcher will ignore that server.

A common reason to set `ServerEvalFn` is to filter servers based on supported dataplane features,
for which you can use the `discovery.SupportsDataplaneFeatures` helper:

```go
cfg := discovery.Config{
    ServerEvalFn: discovery.SupportsDataplaneFeatures(
        pbdataplane.DataplaneFeatures_DATAPLANE_FEATURES_ENVOY_BOOTSTRAP_CONFIGURATION.String(),
    ),
}
```
